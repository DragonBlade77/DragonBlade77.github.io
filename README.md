<!-- I basicially stole this code right from here https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst, HOWEVER I don't know the author name. If you can find it good for you, just saying this isn't mine. -->

so, yeah. This site is still completely pointless. On the plus side, I discovered how easy it was to set it up PURELY using github, and without any other scripts. That's nice. Here, have a DK. If it would show up for once.
