<!-- I basicially stole this code right from here https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst -->
  <p> so uh, there isn't much here right now. Why? well, I've had some fun technical problems with modification. I actually had to full-on restart the project from the beginnning today.
