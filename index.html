  <p> Hey, everyone! Gangplank is a pretty hard character to learn in league of legends, but I would be happy to teach others how to use the champion!</p>
  <p> --Part 1-- </p>
  <p> <bold> learning the ropes </bold> </p>
  <p> The first important aspect of learning the champion is understanding the basics of the champion. There are 5 key ablities that can be read about from the wiki here. Read these FULLY and move to part 2. </p>

    <p> -- Part 2 -- </p>
    <p> Passive Mechanics </p>
   <p> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/12/Trial_by_Fire.png/revision/latest?cb=20150707190028" alt="Trial By Fire" style="width:50px;height:50px;"> First of all, you need to understand his passive. His passive, when procced, does the set amount of true damage<bold> PER PROC</bold>, regardless of what other status afflictions or effects the target may be suffering from. </p>
    <!-- I am using a version of the img src setup from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp, as it's strangely the only one that works. -->
    <p> This means, that it has the ability to stack. Why? I don't know. It's deceptively strong in trades and since it can reset on barrel use, it's very easy to stack. </p>
    <p> Another odd thing to note is that it also affects towers in the same way, still dealing stackable true damage. It makes split pushing very effective, and helps in the early game with tower DPS, when it has it's -50% passive up. </p>
    <p> This is a tool that is very essential to winning trades, and broken at that. Use it OFTEN. </p>
    <p> This, alongside his barrels enable him to bully champions as strong as Darius in lane. It's gross and should not be like that, but I'm not complaining. </p>
    <p> -- Part 3 -- </p>
    <p> Parrrley Utility </p>
    <p> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e3/Parrrley.png/revision/latest?cb=20150707190028" alt="Parrrley" style="width:50px;height:50px;"> Most of us already understand most of how parrrley works. </p>
    <p> We already know that Parrrley gives gold, silver serpents, and you can Q barrels for bonus damage and apply onhit effects. We also know barrels with parrrley explosions also give serpents. </p>
    <p> This is the base of what Gangplank is like in lane. It's a reason to buy corrupting pot, bring Grasp of the Undying and it's incredibly spammable. </p>
    <p> So, We can conclude it's really strong. Most people tend to forget however, that sheen affects its damage. Spellblade is technicially an on-hit effect coded to deal bonus damage by amplifying the AD of the user for a single attack, or at least that's how it functions in practice. </p>
    <p> This is why sheen is such a broken item and works with barrels - and it's why sheen is an amazing item to first by and continue pressure. However, we need to be able to get there. </p>
    <p> Parrrley gives Gangplank an insane amount of presence in lane, and can single-handedly make games horrible for the enemy laner. Applying pressure with Grasp procs makes his Q damage hit roughly 200 early game. </p>
