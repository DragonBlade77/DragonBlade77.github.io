  <p> Hey, everyone! Gangplank is a pretty hard character to learn in league of legends, but I would be happy to teach others how to use the champion!</p>
  <p> --Part 1-- </p>
  <p> <bold> learning the ropes </bold> </p>
  <p> The first important aspect of learning the champion is understanding the basics of the champion. There are 5 key ablities that can be read about from the wiki here. Read these FULLY and move to part 2. </p>

    <p> -- Part 2 -- </p>
    <p> Passive Mechanics </p>
   <p> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/1/12/Trial_by_Fire.png/revision/latest?cb=20150707190028" alt="Trial By Fire" style="width:50px;height:50px;"> First of all, you need to understand his passive. His passive, when procced, does the set amount of true damage<bold> PER PROC</bold>, regardless of what other status afflictions or effects the target may be suffering from. </p>
    <!-- I am using a version of the img src setup from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp, as it's strangely the only one that works. -->
    <p> This means, that it has the ability to stack. Why? I don't know. It's deceptively strong in trades and since it can reset on barrel use, it's very easy to stack. </p>
    <p> Another odd thing to note is that it also affects towers in the same way, still dealing stackable true damage. It makes split pushing very effective, and helps in the early game with tower DPS, when it has it's -50% passive up. </p>
    <p> This is a tool that is very essential to winning trades, and broken at that. Use it OFTEN. </p>
    <p> This, alongside his barrels enable him to bully champions as strong as Darius in lane. It's gross and should not be like that, but I'm not complaining. </p>
    <p> -- Part 3 -- </p>
    <p> Parrrley Utility </p>
    <p> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/e3/Parrrley.png/revision/latest?cb=20150707190028" alt="Parrrley" style="width:50px;height:50px;"> Most of us already understand most of how parrrley works. </p>
    <p> We already know that Parrrley gives gold, silver serpents, and you can Q barrels for bonus damage and apply onhit effects. We also know barrels with parrrley explosions also give serpents. </p>
    <p> This is the base of what Gangplank is like in lane. It's a reason to buy corrupting pot, bring Grasp of the Undying and it's incredibly spammable. </p>
    <p> So, We can conclude it's really strong. Most people tend to forget however, that sheen affects its damage. Spellblade is technicially an on-hit effect coded to deal bonus damage by amplifying the AD of the user for a single attack, or at least that's how it functions in practice. </p>
    <p> This is why sheen is such a broken item and works with barrels - and it's why sheen is an amazing item to first by and continue pressure. However, we need to be able to get there. </p>
    <p> Parrrley gives Gangplank an insane amount of presence in lane, and can single-handedly make games horrible for the enemy laner. Applying pressure with Grasp procs makes his Q damage hit roughly 200 early game. </p>
    <p> With a full understanding of all of this, we can use this info to enable rediculous builds like hybrid and lich bane AP GP, Tankplank (Icebourne Gauntlet), and Bruiser-Plank which procs 10 stack Conqueror (as of patch 10.10). </p>
    <p> Just remember to use it to get farm you normally couldn't, as you get bonus gold and silver serpents as little cost for doing so. </p>
    <p> As for effectively bullying with it, remember to find a rythmm where you can use Q very often without risk of running out of mana, even if you don't use pots. This is a skill you will learn naturally. </p>
    <p> -- Part 4 -- </p>
    <p> A Short Bit on Oranges </p>
    <p> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/9/9c/Remove_Scurvy.png/revision/latest?cb=20150707190028" alt="Remove Scurvy" style="width:50px;height:50px;"> There isn't much to this ability that hasn't already been said. The way this ability works is very simple - if you can QSS it, or you can cleanse it, you can remove it. </p>
    <p> However, I have noticed that some people actually are super clueless about a few of it's interactions. For instance, W removes Mordekaiser's Death Realm, however Mordekaiser keeps the stolen stats for the length of 7 seconds after activation, the normal length of his ultimate. Take the time to learn of more complex interactions like this, as someone who didn't know this could end up say, trading where he would normally win however not realize Mordekaiser has his stats. </p>
    <p> It's important to save oranges until you are either low for maximum effectiveness and unpredictability or to save it for some nasty CC. </p>
    <p> If you are familiar with fighting games, you may be familiar with the terms "startup" and "windup" frames. These are frames before an attack brings out it's hitbox, and slower attacks are much easier to react to. </p>
    <p> Champions in league also have this, and it's really easy to distinguish an animation and cleanse it almost instantly. There are times where this is not the best decision, like waiting out Darius W to cleanse the slow, however it's a very important skill. </p>
    <p> Whether it be the eating animation or a Karma's hand sticking up to fire an empowered Q, it's not hard to time your W if you know what you are doing. </p>
    <p> Also, just something to note that is often overlooked - this scales with AP. This is notable because some Gangplanks like to pick up a Liandry's Torment as a fourth item. I do this myself. </p>
    <p> Gangplank tends to win by the skin of his teeth, so minor things like this add up so much that it can win you a lot more if you just remember to W as efficiently as possible. </p>
    <p> Tracking spell rotations is a good way to provide information on when you should W. Assuming you already practice this for 1v1 purposes top lane or mage matchups midlane, you should immediately recognize why this is so helpful. </p>
    <p> -- Part 5 -- </p>
    <p> Barrel Jank </p>
    <p> <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/4/4e/Powder_Keg.png/revision/latest?cb=20150707190027" alt="Powder Keg" style="width:50px;height:50px;"> This is it. This is your champion. Are you happy now? </p>
    <p> Jokes aside, this ability is a godsend. They zone, they poke, they 1 shot, they scale, they slow, they ignore 40% of the target's armor AND apply Spellblade. These things are gross. </p>
    <p> First of all, know your combos and how they work. If you don't understand these, these are the most well known parts of Gangplank however cannot be simply described. There are many videos on youtube out there so I would suggest you watch those. SolarBacca is a good choice, as he has been the #1 GP NA (Possibly Globally) and has consistently hit top 50 challenger for multiple seasons. He can actually get consistently fed there, too. </p>
    <p> Now that we have that out of the way, there are many little things you have to know. </p>
    <p> First of all, remember to use your melee attacks to proc barrels. Unless you are trading in melee range it's always important to do so. </p>
    <p> The reason being is the aforementioned startup can hinder your ability to proc barrels. Q has a very long startup for a point and click, and has a minimum travel time meaning it's more likely that your opponent will walk up and break the barrels in time. </p>
    <p> For all these reasons, you need to place barrels with intent. If your opponent is mirroring your position, place a barrel by river and move to the alcove side. If you are concerned about a jungle gank, deep ward and place barrels in the river brush by lane or tribrush. Adapt to patterns and punish bad habits. </p>
    <p> Additionally, there is a piece of information relevant to Q farming - knowing kill thresholds on minions. If you want to get silver serpents and gold far faster than your opponent, remember the following. </p>
    <p> The 1-hit Q-Barrel KO range is dependant on level and sheen. If you are levels 5 or below, it takes 2 or more melee hits for a barrel-Q to kill a minion in one hit. If you are either level 6 or have sheen, you can KO casters with 1 hit. </p>
    <p> Melee minions are a bit more unpredictable, however level 6 and sheen means it will ALWAYS take 1 melee swing regardless of caster or melee. Finally, if you have trinity force by level 9 or 10, your barrel-Q's will always 1-hit KO casters. 
    <p> Last of all, remember to get as much lane EXP as possible and get more aggressive when you reach level 7 and 13. Make sure ganks and lane taxing is minimal, only allowing your jungler to stay after a gank IF you are pushing for tower plates. </p>
    <p> Solo EXP is very necessary as Gangplank as he cannot teamfight without level 13. Ranged attackers will almost always ruin your opportunities, and they are the very targets you should aim to kill with barrels. </p>
    <p> -- Part 6 -- </p>
    <p> Using your R effectively </p>
